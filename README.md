# HL2DM Enhancements Pack

A culmination of multiple client-side optimizations, fixes, and enhancements developed and refined by the community, this pack aims to provide the best possible experience for all Half-Life 2: Deathmatch players.

## Summary of Config Changes
**Improved Performance:** This pack adjusts internal settings to help the game run better, especially on poorly optimized maps and during intense firefights. Key visual details have also been adjusted to improve the game's frame rate (FPS), giving a smoother, more consistent experience.

**More Responsive Online Play:** The pack also brings the game's network settings up to more modern standards, sending and receiving data more efficiently. This means your actions—like shooting or moving—will register sooner and feel more in sync with the server. It should also help your connection feel more stable and less prone to stuttering or "rubber-banding."

## Installation

1. Download [_hl2dm_enhancements_by_xeogin.vpk](https://www.hl2dm.com/api/download_github.php?slug=hl2dm-enhancements) and place it in your Half-Life 2: Deathmatch installation's `custom` directory. This is commonly located within:
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2 Deathmatch\hl2mp\custom`

2. **Important:** If you have other content in your `custom` directory, ensure that it does not contain a `valve.rc` file. If one exists, you should either delete it or merge its contents into your `autoexec.cfg` file, as using multiple `valve.rc` files will cause conflicts and prevent full functionality.
